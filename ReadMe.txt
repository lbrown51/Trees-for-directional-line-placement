Class : Project 3

Description:
This project attempts to use trees to define directional placement for lines. Using intersections to build the tree, it should be able to define where, in relation to other lines, a given point is. This project does not do this. It finds the intersection ok. It does not build the tree. It does not crash. It shows a graphical representation of the points and allows you, by clicking to insert more points. 

Zip includes: 5 .java file, readme, OUTPUT, points
